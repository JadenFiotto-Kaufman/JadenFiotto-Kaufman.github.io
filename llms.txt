## Current Work

National Deep Inference Fabric (NDIF) — Northeastern University, Oct 2023 to present. Directed engineering on a $9M NSF grant for democratizing research access to large pre-trained models. Designed and developed NNsight, an open-source Python library for intervening on and interpreting neural network internals. Architected NDIF, a shared inference service supporting models with 400B+ parameters. Built and supervised an engineering team. Deployed services on AWS and Delta (NCSA). Managed partnerships with Anthropic, Goodfire, Transluce, and NCSA.

## Key Projects

- **NNsight**: Open-source library for accessing, manipulating, and interpreting the internals of deep learning models. Enables mechanistic interpretability research at scale. [GitHub](https://github.com/ndif-team/nnsight)
- **NDIF**: National Deep Inference Fabric — a shared research infrastructure providing transparent access to foundation model internals for the academic community. [Website](https://ndif.us)
